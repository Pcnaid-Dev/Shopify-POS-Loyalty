# Shopify POS Loyalty Implementation Details

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the implementation of the Shopify POS Loyalty app. The goal of this project was to display customer points and available rewards in the POS Customer Details block, and allow merchants to apply selected rewards to the cart.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Database Models

Two new models were added to the Prisma schema:

- **CustomerPoints**: Tracks points for each Shopify Customer
  - `customerId` (String, unique): Shopify customer ID
  - `pointsBalance` (Int): Current points balance
  - `createdAt` and `updatedAt`: Timestamps

- **RewardRule**: Defines available rewards
  - `name` (String): Name of the reward
  - `pointsRequired` (Int): Points needed to redeem
  - `discountType` (Enum: PERCENTAGE, FIXED_AMOUNT, FREE_PRODUCT): Type of discount
  - `discountValue` (Float): Value of the discount
  - `productId` (String, optional): For free product rewards
  - `isActive` (Boolean): Whether the reward is active

A `DiscountType` enum was created to represent the different types of discounts available.

### 2. Backend API Endpoints

#### Points Retrieval Endpoint (`points.$customerId.tsx`)

- Retrieves customer points balance and eligible rewards
- Creates a new CustomerPoints record if one doesn't exist
- Calculates points based on order history if needed
- Returns points balance and eligible rewards as JSON

#### Points Deduction Endpoint (`points.$customerId.deduct.tsx`)

- Handles point deduction when rewards are applied
- Uses database transactions to ensure data consistency
- Validates input and handles errors appropriately
- Returns updated points balance

### 3. POS Extension UI

#### Loyalty Points Block (`LoyaltyPointsBlock.tsx`)

- Displays customer points balance
- Shows available rewards based on points balance
- Handles applying rewards to the cart
- Provides appropriate loading and error states

#### Discount Application (`applyDiscount.ts`)

- Applies discounts to the cart based on reward type
- Handles both percentage and fixed amount discounts
- Communicates with backend to deduct points
- Updates UI with new points balance

### 4. Admin Configuration UI

#### Program Settings (`programs.tsx`)

- Allows merchants to configure points per dollar spent
- Validates input and saves settings to database
- Provides feedback on success or failure

#### Reward Management (`rewards.tsx`)

- Provides CRUD operations for reward rules
- Includes a table view of all rewards
- Features a modal for creating/editing rewards
- Allows toggling reward active status

### 5. Testing Utilities

- **Test Data Seeding**: Creates sample customer points and rewards
- **Database Verification**: Confirms models are correctly set up
- **Mock Tests**: Outlines tests for POS extension functionality

## Implementation Decisions

### Database Structure

- Used Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- Implemented proper relationships between models
- Added timestamps for audit purposes
- Used enums for type safety with discount types

### API Design

- Implemented RESTful endpoints for points management
- Used proper authentication for all API calls
- Added CORS headers to allow POS extension access
- Implemented error handling with appropriate status codes

### UI/UX Considerations

- Used Shopify's UI components for consistent look and feel
- Implemented loading states to improve user experience
- Added error handling with user-friendly messages
- Used toasts for feedback on actions

### Security Measures

- Authenticated all API requests
- Validated input data on both client and server
- Used database transactions for data integrity
- Implemented proper error handling

## Future Enhancements

1. **Points Earning**: Implement webhook for orders/paid to automatically award points
2. **Customer History**: Add a view of point earning and redemption history
3. **Advanced Rewards**: Support for more complex reward types (e.g., buy X get Y)
4. **Analytics**: Add reporting on loyalty program effectiveness
5. **Bulk Operations**: Allow bulk import/export of customer points

## Deployment Notes

The implementation is ready for deployment to a Shopify development store. The POS extension should be enabled in the POS channel and added to the Customer Details surface.

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Navigate to `/test` to seed test data
2. Check `/test-results` to verify database setup
3. Configure program settings at `/programs`
4. Create rewards at `/rewards`
5. Test in Shopify POS with a customer that has points

---

This implementation follows the requirements specified in the README.md and provides a solid foundation for a loyalty program that can be extended with additional features in the future.
